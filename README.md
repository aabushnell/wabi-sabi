# Wabi-Sabi

This is my, very much in progress, combined configuration for all my nix systems.
It targets both _linux_ (NixOS) and _darwin_ (MacOS) systems.

## Naming

My host machines are all named after famous _chawan_ tea-bowls, so the configuration
itself is named _wabi-sabi_ after the aesthetic theory underlying the Japanese tea
ceremony. It embodies transcience and imperfection, finding beauty in mundane,
everyday tools. The famous phrase 'chilled and withered' also makes me think
of the nix snowflake.
